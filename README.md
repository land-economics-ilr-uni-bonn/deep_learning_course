# deep_learning_course
In this repository, I host reproducible notebooks and pdf that will take you through the steps in understanding machine learning concepts useful for agricultural economists and environmentalists alike. Specifically the course covers:

* 0_Machine Learning ==> Classical machine learning for an invasive weed monitoring in Uganda.
* 1_Introduction ==> Basic introduction to deep learning.
* 2_Tensors ==> Introduction to `tensor`s that are invaluable data structures for deep learning.
* 3_`PyTorch` ==> Introduction to `PyTorch` with end-to-end model workflow.
* 4_Geospatial AI ==> Introduction to Geospatial Deep Learning using `torchgeo`
